# sql-mini-project
Used SQL to retrieve data from Chinook open source database and gather useful insights through various SQL queries and functions in this SQL Mini Project.

* Loaded the Chinook Database & its ERD with libraries “urlretrieve” and “sqlalchemy ipython-sql”
* Explored Counting, Aggregations, and also joined multiple tables to extract valuable insights
* Created some additional tables with Primary and Foreign Keys through Query.
